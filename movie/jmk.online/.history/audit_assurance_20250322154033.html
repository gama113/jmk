              <article>
                <p>In today&apos;s business environment, audits are often seen
                  as mere compliance checks or routine exercises for many
                  organizations. However, at JMK & Associates, we take a
                  distinctive
                  approach to auditing and assurance. Our services are designed
                  not just to meet regulatory requirements, but to actively
                  evaluate and enhance the financial operations of businesses.
                  Rather than focusing solely on number crunching, we aim to
                  provide a comprehensive understanding of your business&apos;s
                  financial health, processes, and operational efficiency. By
                  deeply engaging with the inner workings of your organization,
                  we help develop refined financial reports, improve
                  record-keeping accuracy, and identify operational gaps that
                  need addressing. This strategic approach ultimately fosters
                  better financial planning, driving operational efficiency and
                  effectiveness over time.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We offer a range of audit services tailored to the specific
                  objectives and scope of your organization&apos;s needs. Here
                  are some of the primary audit types we conduct:

                </p>
                <div class="h_2"><h2>Statutory Audit</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                  A statutory audit is a legally mandated examination of a
                  company&apos;s financial records to ensure accuracy,
                  transparency, and compliance with statutory requirements. This
                  audit verifies the fairness of financial statements, including
                  balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, ensuring that
                  they reflect the true financial position of the business.
                  Statutory audits provide essential assurance to stakeholders
                  about the credibility of the company&apos;s financial
                  reporting and adherence to regulatory standards, reinforcing
                  trust and transparency within the business ecosystem.
                </p>

                <div class="h_2"><h2>Internal Audit
                  </h2>
                </div>
                <p>Internal audits are systematic evaluations of an
                  organization&apos;s operations, controls, and financial
                  procedures conducted internally. These audits are crucial for
                  assessing operational efficiency and identifying potential
                  risks. Our internal audit services focus on ensuring
                  compliance with internal policies, uncovering any weaknesses
                  in operational procedures, and recommending improvements to
                  enhance overall efficiency. This proactive approach helps
                  businesses optimize their governance, internal controls, and
                  overall performance, supporting the achievement of strategic
                  objectives.

                </p>

                <div class="h_2"><h2>Tax Audit</h2>
                </div>

                <p>A tax audit involves a comprehensive review of a
                  taxpayer&apos;s financial records to verify compliance with
                  tax laws and regulations. This audit ensures that income,
                  deductions, and credits are accurately reported in tax
                  returns. We conduct tax audits to identify discrepancies,
                  assess tax liability, and ensure that all relevant financial
                  data is properly documented, reducing the risk of penalties or
                  legal complications for our clients. Our expert team ensures
                  that your business remains compliant with all tax regulations,
                  promoting financial integrity and accountability.

                </p>
                <div class="h_2"><h2>
                    GST Audit
                  </h2>
                </div>
                <p>

                  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) audit is a detailed
                  examination of a taxpayer&apos;s GST returns and associated
                  records to verify compliance with GST laws. This audit ensures
                  that GST calculations, input tax credits, and other
                  tax-related filings are accurate and properly documented. By
                  conducting a GST audit, we help businesses maintain
                  transparency in their tax reporting, reduce the risk of
                  inaccuracies, and ensure that businesses are in full
                  compliance with the latest tax regulations. Our team helps
                  clients manage their GST obligations effectively, providing
                  valuable insights into tax optimization opportunities.

                </p>
                <div class="h_2"><h2>
                    Cost Audit
                  </h2>
                </div><p>

                  Cost audits are focused on examining a company&apos;s cost
                  accounting records and practices to ensure accuracy and
                  compliance with cost accounting standards. This audit
                  evaluates cost structures, cost allocation methods, and the
                  overall effectiveness of cost management practices. Conducted
                  to enhance cost transparency and operational efficiency, cost
                  audits provide businesses with valuable insights into
                  optimizing their cost structure and improving financial
                  decision-making. With a thorough cost audit, organizations can
                  identify areas for cost reduction, maximize profit margins,
                  and streamline operations.
                </p><div class="h_2"><h2>
                    Stock Audit
                  </h2>
                </div><p>
                  A stock audit involves a detailed inspection of physical
                  inventory to verify the accuracy and completeness of stock
                  records. The goal of a stock audit is to reconcile the
                  physical stock with book records, identifying any
                  discrepancies such as shortages, overages, or inaccuracies.
                  Stock audits are essential for businesses to maintain
                  inventory integrity, prevent fraud, and enhance operational
                  efficiency. By ensuring that inventory records are accurate,
                  companies can optimize their stock management practices,
                  reduce wastage, and improve overall supply chain operations.

                <p>
                  A Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) audit reviews the accuracy and
                  compliance of TDS deductions and remittances made by
                  businesses. This audit ensures that TDS has been correctly
                  deducted at applicable rates and deposited with the tax
                  authorities in a timely manner. Our TDS audit services help
                  businesses ensure compliance with TDS provisions, mitigate the
                  risks of penalties for incorrect deductions, and maintain
                  financial transparency. With our expert guidance, businesses
                  can navigate TDS regulations with confidence and minimize the
                  risk of tax-related issues.

                    Management Audit

                <p>
                  A management audit assesses the effectiveness of an
                  organization&apos;s management practices, processes, and
                  strategies. This type of audit evaluates management
                  decision-making, resource allocation, leadership
                  effectiveness, and overall organizational performance. By
                  conducting a management audit, businesses gain valuable
                  insights into areas where improvements can be made, whether in
                  leadership, strategy execution, or resource management. The
                  goal of a management audit is to optimize operations, enhance
                  strategic alignment, and foster sustainable growth through
                  improved management practices.
